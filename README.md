# Tutorials

* Very good youtube tutorial on [setting up][Shaffer tutorial]
vscode by  [Corey Schafer][]

# VScode setup

1. Did not [delete VScode][Delete VSCode and settings].
1. To remove all user data after uninstalling VS Code, delete the folders
    * %APPDATA%\Code (%APPDATA% is `C:\Users\John\AppData\Roaming`)
    * %USERPROFILE%\.vscode  (%USERPROFILE%\ is `C:\Users\John`)
1. Sync settings restores all setting from github turn this off if you do
not want this to happen

## VSCode global settings

To copy your VS Code global settings from one account to another,

* Copy your global settings manually by copying the contents of the
`settings.json` file located at
`C:\Users\{Username}\AppData\Roaming\Code\User` to the new device.

## VSCode extension settings

Copy your VS Code extensions from one device to another:

1. Open **File Explorer** on the device where your extensions are
currently installed.
2. Navigate to `C:\Users\{Username}\.vscode\extensions`. This folder
contains all your extensions.
3. Copy the entire `extensions` folder.
4. Transfer the copied folder to the second device using a USB drive,
cloud storage, or any other preferred method.
5. On the second device, open **File Explorer** and navigate to
`C:\Users\{Username}\.vscode`.
6. Paste the `extensions` folder in this directory.
7. Open VS Code on the second device and your extensions should be available.

# Predefined variables

These variables caused a lot of confusion because they use the `\`
in the path name. The `\` is an escape character and needs to be used
in `json` files.

The way of referencing the home directory is `~` thus a file in a
json file, is for example, is referenced as
`"~/AppData/Roaming/Code-Data/dictionaries/sympy-attributes.txt"`

* ${userHome} - the path of the user's home folder
* ${workspaceFolder} - the path of the folder opened in VS Code
* ${workspaceFolderBasename} - the name of the folder opened in VS Code without any slashes (/)
* ${file} - the current opened file
* ${fileWorkspaceFolder} - the current opened file's workspace folder
* ${relativeFile} - the current opened file relative to workspaceFolder
* ${relativeFileDirname} - the current opened file's dirname relative to workspaceFolder
* ${fileBasename} - the current opened file's basename
* ${fileBasenameNoExtension} - the current opened file's basename with no file extension
* ${fileExtname} - the current opened file's extension
* ${fileDirname} - the current opened file's folder path
* ${fileDirnameBasename} - the current opened file's folder name
* ${cwd} - the task runner's current working directory upon the startup of VS Code
* ${lineNumber} - the current selected line number in the active file
* ${selectedText} - the current selected text in the active file
* ${execPath} - the path to the running VS Code executable
* ${defaultBuildTask} - the name of the default build task
* ${pathSeparator} - the character used by the operating system to separate components in file paths

# Environment variables

You can also reference environment variables through the
`${env:Name}` syntax (for example, `${env:USERNAME}`).

```json

{
  "type": "node",
  "request": "launch",
  "name": "Launch Program",
  "program": "${workspaceFolder}/app.js",
  "cwd": "${workspaceFolder}",
  "args": ["${env:USERNAME}"]
}

```

# Street Side Software

The [Street Side Software][] extension is used to check the code.
It is installed through the extensions tab.

## Dictionaries

The dictionaries are stored in the following directory

```json
"~/AppData/Roaming/Code-Data/dictionaries/sympy-attributes.txt"
```

and is placed in the global settings as follows

```json
    "cSpell.customDictionaries": {
        "sympy-attributes": {
            "name": "sympy-words",
            "path": "~/AppData/Roaming/Code-Data/dictionaries/sympy-attributes.txt",
            "description": "Attributes of SymPy objects",
            "addWords": false
        },
        "custom": true, // Enable the `custom` dictionary
        "internal-terms": false // Disable the `internal-terms` dictionary
    }
```

# Pico and Pico-Go

A lot of electronics is performed using the [Pico board][]
and [Cytron Maker board][] (Pico based). Most of the
[Grove Pico Starter Kit][] can be performed on the [Cytron Maker board][].
Documentation for Starter Kit can be found at  
[Grove Pico Starter Kit][]. In essence the Grove Pico header is replaced
by the Cytron Maker.

The extension [Pico-Go][] enables the Pico to be managed from vscode.
The extension [Pico-Go][] required some effort to install because of
misunderstanding of the process.

* The linking LED did not work until

```json
"terminal.integrated.env.windows": {
        "PYTHONPATH": "${workspaceFolder}\\.;${workspaceFolder}\\test"
    }
```

was added to `settings.json`

* Use of the FTP server in [Pico-Go][] is essential to upload Microphone code to the Pico.
* It seems much easier to develop code on vscode and executed it through [Thonny][]

# Useful Global settings

Use json instead of the standard UI

```json
 // Determines which settings editor to use by default.
 //  - ui: Use the settings UI editor.
 //  - json: Use the JSON file editor.
 "workbench.settings.editor": "json",
```

A list of all the default settings can be opened through the settings option.

```json
// Controls whether opening settings also opens an editor showing all default settings.
 "workbench.settings.openDefaultSettings": true,
```

```json
// Controls which editor is shown at startup, if none are restored from the previous session.
 //  - none: Start without an editor.
 //  - welcomePage: Open the Welcome page, with content to aid in getting started with VS Code and extensions.
 //  - readme: Open the README when opening a folder that contains one, fallback to 'welcomePage' otherwise. Note: This is only observed as a global configuration, it will be ignored if set in a workspace or folder configuration.
 //  - newUntitledFile: Open a new untitled file (only applies when opening an empty window).
 //  - welcomePageInEmptyWorkbench: Open the Welcome page when opening an empty workbench.
 "workbench.startupEditor": "none",
```

# Settings

The set of of Visual Studio code proved a challenge. Here are the settings to enable the local source files to be accessible from VScode. The settings `"python.defaultInterpreterPath"` for python and `"terminal.integrated.env.windows"` are important to execute python and pico correctly.

From default settings:

```json
// Object with environment variables that will be added to the VS Code process to be used by the terminal on Windows. Set to `null` to delete the environment variable.
 "terminal.integrated.env.windows": {},
```

The following is `settings.json`

```json
{
    "editor.formatOnSave": true,
    "python.defaultInterpreterPath": "D:\\Users\\John\\Anaconda3\\envs\\3.7\\python.exe",
    "python.testing.unittestArgs": [
        "-v",
        "-s",
        "./test",
        "-p",
        "test*.py"
    ],
    "python.analysis.typeshedPaths": [
        ".vscode\\Pico-Stub"
    ],
    "python.languageServer": "Pylance",
    "python.analysis.typeCheckingMode": "basic",
    "python.analysis.extraPaths": [
        ".vscode\\Pico-Stub\\stubs"
    ],
    "terminal.integrated.env.windows": {
        "PYTHONPATH": "${workspaceFolder};${workspaceFolder}/test"
    }
}
```

# Pylance

**[Pylance][]** is a language server extension for **Visual Studio Code
(VS Code)** that provides
**[fast and feature-rich language support for Python][]**.
It works alongside the Python extension in VS Code to enhance the Python
development experience. Pylance is powered by **Pyright**, Microsoft's
static type checking tool, which enables it to provide performant
language support. By leveraging Pyright, Pylance enhances the Python
IntelliSense experience by offering rich type information, helping
developers write better code more efficiently

Some of the key features provided by Pylance include:

* **Docstrings**: Pylance offers signature help with type information,
parameter suggestions, and code completion.
* **Auto-imports**: It provides automatic import suggestions and actions
to add or remove import statements
* **Code error and warning reporting**: Pylance reports code errors and
warnings as you type, helping you catch potential issues early onÂ¹.
* **Code outline and navigation**: It offers a code outline for easy
navigation within your Python codebase.
* **Type checking mode**: Pylance supports different levels of type
checking analysis, allowing you to choose the desired level of type
checking.
* **Native multi-root workspace support**: It seamlessly integrates
with multi-root workspaces in VS Code.
* **IntelliCode compatibility**: Pylance is compatible with IntelliCode,
which provides AI-assisted code completions based on your coding patterns
and practices.

To get started with Pylance, you can install the Python extension from
the VS Code marketplace. Pylance will be installed as an optional
extension alongside it. Once you open a Python (.py) file, the Pylance
extension will activate automatically.

Please note that Pylance is specifically designed for Python development
in VS Code and may not be applicable to other programming languages or
IDEs.

----

```python.analysis.typeCheckingMode```

* Used to specify the level of type checking analysis performed.
  * Default: off.
  * Note that the default value is set to "basic" when using VS Code
    Insiders, and to "off" otherwise.

* Available values:
  * off: No type checking analysis is conducted; unresolved
    imports/variables diagnostics are produced
  * basic: Non-type checking-related rules (all rules in off) + basic type
    checking rules
  * strict: All type checking rules at the highest severity of error
    (includes all rules in off and basic categories)

* ```"python.analysis.typeCheckingMode": "basic"```

----

```python.analysis.diagnosticSeverityOverrides```

* Used to allow a user to override the severity levels for individual
diagnostics should they desire.
* Accepted severity values:
  * error (red squiggle)
  * warning (yellow squiggle)
  * information (blue squiggle)
  * none (disables the rule)

* [Available diagnostic severity overrides rules][]

    ```json
    "python.analysis.diagnosticSeverityOverrides": {
        "reportGeneralTypeIssues": "warning"
    }

    ```

# Jupyter

Jupyter description in VScode is described well in
[VScode Jupyter documentation][].
Custom **notebook diffing** is especially interesting

# cSpell

Add words to the dictionary by right clicking on the word and selecting
`Add to dictionary` and `Add to workspace dictionary`

The following json code added to `.vscode`introduces a custom dictionary
`sympy-attributes.txt` and to spell check the `custom` dictionary and
the `internal-terms`
dictionary.

```json
    "cSpell.customDictionaries": {
        "sympy-attributes": {
            "name": "project-words",
            "path": "${workspaceRoot}/sympy-attributes.txt",
            "description": "Words used in this project",
            "addWords": false
        },
        "custom": true, // Enable the `custom` dictionary
        "internal-terms": false // Disable the `internal-terms` dictionary
    }
```

# Micropython source

The `.env` can be used to specify the origin of source files is as follows

```json
WORKSPACE_FOLDER=D:/Users/John/Documents/Computers/RaspberryPi/MicroPython
PYTHONPATH=${workspaceFolder};${WORKSPACE_FOLDER}/test
```

# Pico source

The `.env` is as follows

```json
WORKSPACE_FOLDER=D:/Users/John/Documents/Computers/RaspberryPi/pico_project
PYTHONPATH=${WORKSPACE_FOLDER};${WORKSPACE_FOLDER}/test
```
